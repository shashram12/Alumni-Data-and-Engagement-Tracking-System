# Alumni-Data-and-Engagement-Tracking-System
The Master of Information Management (MIM) program needs a system to collect contact information from alumni along with their areas of interest in volunteering. These areas of interest include mentoring, mock interviews, alumni panels and resume review sessions. In addition to providing functionality for the alumni to submit this information, it will also require a front-end application for the faculty to query information on the alumni interest areas and contact information.
